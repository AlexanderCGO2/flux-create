# Voice Commands & Automatic Speech Detection

## üé§ New Voice Experience

**FluxCreate now features automatic Voice Activity Detection (VAD)!**

### How It Works

1. **Click the microphone button once** - This activates "listening mode"
2. **Speak naturally** - The system automatically detects when you start speaking and begins recording

4. **Get feedback** - The system responds with confirmation and executes your command

### Visual Indicators

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Tips

### Voice Settings
- **Microphone Sensitivity**: Automatically calibrated
- **Speech Detection**: 300ms minimum speech duration
- **Silence Detection**: 1.5 seconds of silence ends recording
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes maximum listening session

### Best Practices
1. **Speak clearly** - Enunciate your words
2. **Wait for visual feedback** - Look for the green listening indicator
3. **Use natural language** - "Make it brighter" works as well as "Increase brightness"
4. **Be specific with numbers** - "Set brightness to 75" vs "Make it brighter"
5. **Wait between commands** - Let one command finish before the next

### Troubleshooting

#### "Not listening"
- Check microphone permissions in browser
- Click the microphone button to start listening
- Look for green pulsing speaker icon

#### "Recording but not processing"
- Speak for at least 300ms
- Wait 1.5 seconds of silence for auto-stop
- Ensure clear speech without background noise

#### "Command not recognized"
- Try rephrasing the command
- Use examples from this guide
- Check if command is supported in current mode

#### "Voice service error"
- Check internet connection
- Verify OpenAI API key is configured
- Try the "Test API" button for diagnostics

## üîß Technical Notes
